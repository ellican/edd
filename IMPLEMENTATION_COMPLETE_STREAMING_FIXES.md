# Live Streaming Playback and Management Fixes - Implementation Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of fixes for the live streaming feature, addressing HLS playback issues, engagement timing, SQL overflow errors, and stream management enhancements.

## Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

All code changes have been implemented and validated. The system is ready for manual testing and deployment.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ HLS Playback - "Unable to Load Stream" Error

**Problem:** Viewers saw "Unable to Load Stream" error when trying to watch live streams, even when the stream was active.

**Root Cause:** 
- No retry mechanism when HLS manifest wasn't immediately available
- Poor error handling for network issues
- No feedback to user about stream status

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added intelligent retry mechanism (12 attempts over 1 minute)
- Show "Waiting for stream to start..." UI with attempt counter
- Automatic transition to playing state when manifest becomes available
- Proper error recovery for transient network issues
- Enhanced error messages for debugging

**Files Changed:**
- `js/live-stream-player.js` - Complete rewrite of initialization logic

**Key Features:**
```javascript
// Retry with exponential awareness
this.maxRetries = 12; // 1 minute total (12 * 5 seconds)
this.retryInterval = 5000; // 5 seconds between attempts

// Proper detection of playable state
this.hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, () => {
    this.streamPlayable = true;
    this.startEngagement(); // Only after confirmed playable
});
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Simulated Engagement Starting Prematurely

**Problem:** Viewer counts and likes started incrementing before the stream was actually playing, creating inaccurate metrics.

**Root Cause:**
- Engagement timers started when page loaded, not when stream was playable
- No check for MANIFEST_PARSED event

**Solution Implemented:**
- Engagement only starts after `MANIFEST_PARSED` event confirms stream is playable
- Viewer updates start 10 seconds after playback
- Like updates start 30 seconds after playback
- Randomized intervals (5-13 seconds) for natural growth patterns
- Randomized increments (1-3) for realistic engagement
- All timers properly cleaned up on stream end or errors

**Files Changed:**
- `js/live-stream-player.js` - New engagement timing logic

**Key Features:**
```javascript
startEngagement() {
    // Only called after MANIFEST_PARSED
    this.engagementStarted = true;
    
    // Viewer updates after 10s
    setTimeout(() => this.scheduleViewerUpdates(), 10000);
    
    // Like updates after 30s
    setTimeout(() => this.scheduleLikeUpdates(), 30000);
}

scheduleViewerUpdates() {
    // Random interval: 5-13 seconds
    const randomInterval = (5 + Math.random() * 8) * 1000;
    // ... update logic ...
    this.viewerTimer = setTimeout(() => this.scheduleViewerUpdates(), randomInterval);
}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ SQL Error: Numeric Value Out of Range (duration_seconds)

**Problem:** 
```
SQLSTATE[22003]: Numeric value out of range: 1264 Out of range value for column 'duration_seconds'
```

**Root Cause:**
- Column was `INT UNSIGNED` (max value: 4,294,967,295 seconds = ~136 years)
- However, negative values or calculation errors could cause issues
- No bounds checking on duration calculation

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed column type to `BIGINT UNSIGNED` for future-proofing
- Added duration clamping (0 to 172800 seconds = 48 hours max)
- Added proper error handling with try-catch
- Cast to int to ensure proper type
- Detailed error logging for debugging

**Files Changed:**
- `database/migrations/059_add_duration_seconds_to_live_streams.php` - Changed to BIGINT UNSIGNED
- `api/streams/end.php` - Added duration calculation and clamping logic

**Key Features:**
```php
// Safe duration calculation
$startTime = strtotime($stream['started_at']);
$endTime = time();
$duration = max(0, $endTime - $startTime);

// Clamp to maximum (48 hours)
$maxDuration = 172800;
if ($duration > $maxDuration) {
    error_log("Stream {$streamId} duration exceeded maximum: {$duration} seconds, clamping to {$maxDuration}");
    $duration = $maxDuration;
}

// Cast to int
$duration = (int)$duration;

// Wrap in try-catch
try {
    $stmt->execute([$videoUrl, $duration, $stream['peak_viewers'], $streamId]);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    error_log("Failed to save stream {$streamId}: " . $e->getMessage());
    throw new Exception('Failed to save stream: Database error');
}
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Seller Stream Management Page Enhancements

**Problem:** The streams.php page needed better integration with the backend and improved functionality.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Verified all API endpoints work correctly
- Fixed video file deletion to use proper filesystem paths
- Added error logging for file operations
- All modals and confirmations work as designed
- Auto-refresh for active streams every 10 seconds

**Files Changed:**
- `api/streams/delete.php` - Fixed file deletion logic
- `seller/streams.php` - Already had all necessary functionality

**Key Features:**
```php
// Proper file path conversion
if ($stream['video_path']) {
    $filePath = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $stream['video_path'];
    if (file_exists($filePath)) {
        $deleted = @unlink($filePath);
        if ($deleted) {
            error_log("Deleted video file for stream {$streamId}: {$filePath}");
        } else {
            error_log("Failed to delete video file for stream {$streamId}: {$filePath}");
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Additional Improvements

**Page Visibility Handling:**
- Added `visibilitychange` event listener to detect tab switches
- Logs state changes for debugging
- Maintains playback during tab switches
- Could be extended to pause engagement when hidden

**File:** `live.php`

```javascript
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', function() {
    if (document.hidden) {
        console.log('üì¥ Page hidden, pausing engagement updates');
    } else {
        console.log('üì± Page visible, resuming normal operation');
    }
});
```

**Proper Resource Cleanup:**
- All timers (viewer, like, status) cleared in destroy()
- HLS instance properly destroyed
- Video element cleaned up
- Engagement marked as stopped

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Review all code changes
- [ ] Run validation script: `php validate_streaming_fixes.php`
- [ ] Check PHP syntax: `php -l api/streams/*.php`
- [ ] Verify database connection works
- [ ] Run database migration 059

### Database Migration

```bash
# Option 1: Using migration runner (if available)
php run_migration.php 059

# Option 2: Direct SQL (be careful!)
mysql -u username -p database_name << EOF
ALTER TABLE live_streams 
MODIFY duration_seconds BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL 
COMMENT 'Total stream duration in seconds';
EOF
```

### Web Server Configuration

**Nginx:**
```bash
# Edit nginx config
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site

# Add HLS location block (see docs/HLS_STREAMING_SETUP.md)

# Test config
sudo nginx -t

# Reload
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**Apache:**
```bash
# Enable required modules
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod rewrite

# Edit virtual host or .htaccess
# (see docs/HLS_STREAMING_SETUP.md)

# Test config
sudo apachectl configtest

# Reload
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

### Post-Deployment Testing

1. **HLS Playback Test:**
   ```bash
   # Test CORS headers
   curl -I -H "Origin: https://yourdomain.com" \
     https://yourdomain.com/streams/hls/test_stream/playlist.m3u8
   
   # Should see: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   ```

2. **Browser Console Test:**
   - Navigate to /live.php
   - Open DevTools Console
   - Look for engagement timing messages:
     - "‚úÖ HLS manifest parsed successfully"
     - "üéØ Starting engagement timers (after stream is playable)"
     - "üë• Viewer engagement started (10 seconds after playback)"
     - "üëç Like engagement started (30 seconds after playback)"

3. **Duration Test:**
   - Start a test stream
   - End after a few minutes
   - Check database:
     ```sql
     SELECT id, title, duration_seconds, 
            TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, started_at, ended_at) as calculated
     FROM live_streams 
     WHERE status = 'archived' 
     ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
     ```

4. **File Deletion Test:**
   - Delete an archived stream from /seller/streams.php
   - Check filesystem:
     ```bash
     ls -la /var/www/uploads/streams/[vendor_id]/
     ```
   - Verify file is removed

## Monitoring and Logging

### Key Log Locations

**Application Logs:**
```bash
# Apache
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log | grep -E "(Stream|duration|engagement)"

# Nginx
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log | grep -E "(Stream|duration|engagement)"
```

**Database Logs:**
```bash
# MySQL/MariaDB
tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log | grep -E "(live_streams|duration_seconds)"
```

### Metrics to Monitor

1. **Stream Playback:**
   - HLS manifest load success rate
   - Average time to first frame
   - Buffer health
   - Error rate (by error type)

2. **Engagement:**
   - Viewer count growth patterns
   - Like/dislike ratios
   - Comment frequency
   - Time to first engagement

3. **Database:**
   - Query performance on live_streams table
   - Duration_seconds values (check for outliers)
   - Number of streams by status

4. **File System:**
   - Disk space usage in /uploads/streams/
   - File deletion success rate
   - Orphaned video files (no DB record)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unable to Load Stream" persists

**Check:**
1. Console shows retry attempts? ‚Üí Good, retry logic is working
2. After 12 retries still fails? ‚Üí Stream may not be broadcasting
3. Check stream status in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, status, stream_key, stream_url 
   FROM live_streams WHERE id = ?;
   ```
4. Verify HLS files exist:
   ```bash
   ls -la /var/www/hls/[stream_key]/
   ```

### Issue: Engagement starts before video plays

**Check:**
1. Look for console message: "üéØ Starting engagement timers"
2. Should only appear AFTER: "‚úÖ HLS manifest parsed successfully"
3. If not, verify you're using the latest live-stream-player.js
4. Clear browser cache and hard reload

### Issue: SQL overflow error on stream end

**Check:**
1. Verify migration ran: `DESCRIBE live_streams;`
2. Column should show: `bigint unsigned`
3. If not, run migration 059 again
4. Check error logs for duration values

### Issue: Video file not deleted

**Check:**
1. Error logs: `grep "Failed to delete" /var/log/apache2/error.log`
2. File permissions: `ls -la /var/www/uploads/streams/`
3. Web server should have write access
4. Fix permissions: `chmod 755 /var/www/uploads/streams/`
