# KYC System Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes and enhancements made to the KYC (Know Your Customer) management system to address critical security and functionality issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. âœ… Fixed 404 Error on Document View
**Problem:** Admins encountered 404 errors when trying to view submitted KYC documents.

**Solution:** 
- Created a secure download endpoint at `/admin/kyc/download.php`
- Handles both user KYC documents and seller KYC documents
- Properly resolves file paths and serves files securely
- Includes access control and audit logging

**Testing:**
1. Navigate to `/admin/kyc/` as an admin user
2. Click the "Download" button next to any KYC document
3. Verify the file downloads successfully without 404 error

### 2. âœ… Added Document Download Option
**Problem:** No download button existed for KYC documents in the admin panel.

**Solution:**
- Added download buttons in the KYC documents list view (`/admin/kyc/index.php`)
- Added download buttons in individual document review pages (`/admin/kyc/view.php`)
- Download buttons appear for all document types (identity, address, bank verification)
- Each download is logged for audit purposes

**Testing:**
1. Go to `/admin/kyc/` and view the documents list
2. Look for the green download button (ðŸ“¥ icon) next to each document
3. For seller KYC, go to `/admin/kyc/view.php?id=X` to see download buttons for each document type

### 3. âœ… Implemented Virus Scanning on Uploads
**Problem:** No security scanning was performed on uploaded files, creating potential security vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**
Created comprehensive virus scanning service (`/includes/services/VirusScanService.php`) that:
- Validates file extensions against dangerous types (exe, bat, php, etc.)
- Performs MIME type validation
- Scans file content for suspicious patterns (eval, base64_decode, system calls, etc.)
- Checks for null byte injection and embedded code
- Provides integration hooks for ClamAV (if available)
- Logs all scan results

**Files Protected:**
- âœ… KYC documents (`/seller/kyc.php`)
- âœ… Product images (`/admin/products/create.php`)
- âœ… Chat attachments (`/api/messages/send.php`)
- âœ… Media library uploads (`/admin/media/index.php`)

**Testing:**
1. Try uploading a legitimate image file (JPG/PNG) - should work
2. Try uploading a PHP file - should be blocked
3. Try uploading a file with executable extension - should be blocked
4. Check error logs for scan results: `grep "VirusScan" /var/log/apache2/error.log`

### 4. âœ… Repaired Admin KYC Dashboard
**Problem:** Dashboard showed incorrect zero-value statistics.

**Solution:**
- Updated statistics queries in `/admin/kyc/index.php` to handle different table structures
- Added error handling for missing tables or columns
- Queries now properly aggregate data from both `kyc_documents` and `seller_kyc` tables
- Added fallback logic for database schema variations

**Testing:**
1. Go to `/admin/kyc/` as an admin
2. Verify the statistics cards show actual numbers (not all zeros)
3. Check for: Total Documents, Pending Review, Approved, Rejected, Expired, Verified Users

## New Files Created

### 1. `/admin/kyc/download.php`
Secure download handler for KYC documents with:
- Admin authentication required
- Permission checking
- Support for both user and seller KYC types
- Audit logging
- Proper content-type headers

### 2. `/includes/services/VirusScanService.php`
Comprehensive security scanning service:
- Extension validation
- MIME type checking
- Pattern-based malware detection
- File content analysis
- ClamAV integration support

### 3. `/includes/SecureFileUploadHandler.php`
Reusable file upload handler:
- Integrated virus scanning
- Validation and sanitization
- Unique filename generation
- Multi-file upload support
- Error handling and reporting

## Modified Files

### Admin Panel
- `/admin/kyc/index.php` - Fixed statistics, added download buttons
- `/admin/kyc/view.php` - Added download buttons for seller documents
- `/admin/products/create.php` - Added virus scanning
- `/admin/media/index.php` - Added virus scanning

### User-Facing
- `/seller/kyc.php` - Added virus scanning to document uploads

### API Endpoints
- `/api/messages/send.php` - Added virus scanning to chat attachments

## Security Features

### File Upload Security
1. **Extension Whitelist:** Only approved file types allowed
2. **MIME Type Validation:** Ensures file content matches extension
3. **Virus Scanning:** Multi-layer malware detection
4. **Size Limits:** Prevents resource exhaustion
5. **Content Analysis:** Detects embedded malicious code
6. **Unique Filenames:** Prevents file overwriting attacks

### Download Security
1. **Authentication Required:** Admin access only
2. **Permission Checks:** Role-based access control
3. **File Path Validation:** Prevents directory traversal
4. **Audit Logging:** All downloads are logged
5. **CSRF Protection:** Uses CSRF tokens

## Configuration

### Virus Scanner Settings
Edit `/includes/services/VirusScanService.php` to customize:

```php
// Max file size to scan (default: 10MB)
$this->maxFileSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024;

// Add/remove dangerous extensions
$this->dangerousExtensions = ['exe', 'bat', 'cmd', ...];

// Add/remove suspicious patterns
$this->suspiciousPatterns = ['/eval\s*\(/i', ...];
```

### Upload Handler Settings
Edit `/includes/SecureFileUploadHandler.php` to customize:

```php
// Allowed file extensions
$this->allowedExtensions = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', ...];

// Max file size (default: 10MB)
$this->maxFileSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
```

## Error Handling

All components include comprehensive error handling:
- Files log errors to PHP error log
- User-friendly error messages displayed
- Security events logged for audit
- Graceful degradation if optional features unavailable

## Database Compatibility

The KYC statistics queries handle multiple database schema variations:
- Works with `kyc_documents` table having `user_id` column
- Works with `kyc_documents` table having `kyc_request_id` column
- Gracefully handles missing tables
- Fallback for different column names (`original_filename` vs `file_name`)

## Monitoring and Logging

### Audit Events Logged
- File downloads (with user, file, timestamp)
- Virus scan results (safe/blocked, threats detected)
- Upload failures (reason)
- Security violations (blocked files)

### Log Locations
- PHP error log: `/var/log/apache2/error.log` or configured location
- Application logs: Check `error_log()` calls in code
- Audit log: Via `logAuditEvent()` function if configured

## Performance Considerations

1. **Virus Scanning:** Files up to 10MB scanned; larger files skipped for performance
2. **Caching:** MIME type detection uses finfo (fast)
3. **Database Queries:** Optimized with proper indexes
4. **File Serving:** Uses readfile() for efficient streaming

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Integration with commercial virus scanning APIs
2. Automated expiry notifications for KYC documents
3. Bulk download for multiple documents
4. Document versioning and history
5. OCR for automated document data extraction
6. Real-time scan status updates via WebSocket

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check PHP error logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify file permissions on upload directories
3. Ensure all required PHP extensions are installed
4. Test with small files first to isolate issues

## Compliance

This implementation supports compliance with:
- GDPR (secure document handling)
- PCI-DSS (secure file uploads)
- KYC/AML regulations (audit trail)
- General security best practices
