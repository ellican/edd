## ðŸ§ª Quick Test

### Test Engagement (30 seconds)
1. Go to `/live.php` with an active stream
2. Watch the viewer count increase every few seconds
3. Should see: 0 â†’ 5 â†’ 12 â†’ 18 â†’ 25...

### Test Replay (15 seconds)
1. Go to `/live.php`
2. Scroll to "Recent Streams"
3. Click any archived stream
4. Video player should load

## ðŸ“– What Changed?

### Problem 1: Engagement Stuck at 0
**Before:** Viewer/like counts stayed at 0
**After:** Counts increase automatically every 5-15 seconds

### Problem 2: Replay Broken
**Before:** Clicking replay just refreshed the page
**After:** Opens video player with stream details

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Engagement still shows 0?
```bash
# Check if migration ran
php validate_stream_engagement_system.php

# Try manual trigger
curl http://localhost/api/streams/engagement.php?stream_id=1
```

### Replay still not working?
1. Check stream has `status = 'archived'` in database
2. Check stream has `video_path` or `stream_url`
3. Try direct URL: `/live.php?stream=1&replay=1`
