# Pull Request Summary: Fix Unresponsive Buttons on Account Settings Page

## Overview
This PR fixes critical issues with unresponsive buttons on the account settings page at `https://fezamarket.com/account.php?section=settings`.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå "Add Payment Method" Button Not Working
**Symptom:** After Stripe keys were configured, clicking the "Add payment Method" button did nothing. Button appeared completely unresponsive with no visible error.

**Root Cause:** Inadequate error handling in the `addPaymentMethod()` function meant that errors during Stripe initialization were not caught, causing silent failures that made the button appear broken.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### 2. ‚ùå Wallet Buttons Not Clickable  
**Symptom:** The "Add Funds", "Transfer", and "Withdraw" buttons in the wallet section were not clickable and appeared to be disabled.

**Root Cause:** JavaScript function name conflict. The `showTransferModal()` function was defined in both `account-management.js` and `account.php`, with the wrong version being called when buttons were clicked, causing them to malfunction.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
