## Technical Details

### Engagement Timing Implementation

```javascript
// Viewers: Start after 10s, update every 5-20s
setTimeout(() => {
    function scheduleViewerIncrease() {
        const randomDelay = (5 + Math.random() * 15) * 1000;
        setTimeout(() => {
            triggerEngagement(currentStreamId);
            scheduleViewerIncrease();
        }, randomDelay);
    }
    scheduleViewerIncrease();
}, 10000);

// Likes: Start after 30s, update every 10-30s
setTimeout(() => {
    function scheduleLikeIncrease() {
        const randomDelay = (10 + Math.random() * 20) * 1000;
        setTimeout(() => {
            triggerEngagement(currentStreamId);
            scheduleLikeIncrease();
        }, randomDelay);
    }
    scheduleLikeIncrease();
}, 30000);
```

### Database Schema Updates

**live_streams table:**
- `video_path` - Stores path to saved video file
- `viewer_count` - Final viewer count
- `like_count` - Final like count
- `comment_count` - Final comment count
- `total_revenue` - Final revenue amount
- `status` - 'archived' for saved streams, 'ended' for deleted

### Modal Player Features

1. **Standard Video Controls:**
   - Play/Pause
   - Seek bar
   - Volume control
   - Fullscreen
   - No download (controlsList="nodownload")

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Max width: 1200px
   - Max height: 70vh
   - Adapts to screen size
   - Touch-friendly on mobile

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Video error handler shows fallback UI
   - Missing videos show placeholder message
   - No JavaScript errors on failures

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Uses IntersectionObserver API
   - 50px margin for early loading
   - Fallback for older browsers
   - Smooth fade-in effect

2. **Video Loading:**
   - preload="metadata" for faster initial load
   - Multiple source formats (MP4, WebM)
   - Error recovery with fallback UI

   - Videos stored in protected uploads directory

2. **API Authentication:**
   - All APIs check user login status
   - Vendor verification for stream operations
   - Stream ownership validation

3. **XSS Prevention:**
   - All user input escaped with escapeHtml()
   - SQL injection prevented with prepared statements

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation is fully functional, potential future improvements could include:

2. **Advanced Player Features:**
   - Playback speed control
   - Quality selection
   - Subtitles/captions support
   - Picture-in-picture mode

3. **Enhanced Analytics:**
