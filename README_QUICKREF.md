# Quick Reference: KYC Dashboard & Cart UI Fixes

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. KYC Dashboard Issue
**Problem:** Seller KYC submissions not visible to admin  
**Solution:** Combined query to show both user and seller KYC  
**File:** `/admin/kyc/index.php`

### 2. Shopping Cart Issue
**Problem:** Cart positioned incorrectly at bottom of footer  
**Solution:** Strengthened CSS with !important flags  
**File:** `/includes/floating-cart.php`

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### To Test KYC Dashboard
```bash
# 1. Navigate to admin KYC dashboard
URL: /admin/kyc/

# 2. Look for yellow "Seller" badges in Type column
# 3. Use "Type Filter" dropdown to filter by type
# 4. Verify statistics include both types
```

### To Test Shopping Cart
```bash
# 1. Navigate to home page
URL: /

# 2. Click cart icon in header
# 3. Verify cart slides in from right as overlay
# 4. Check that cart floats over content, not in footer
```

SELECT * FROM kyc_documents kd
JOIN users u ON kd.user_id = u.id
WHERE ...
```

### After (Combined)
```sql
SELECT ..., 'user' as kyc_type FROM kyc_documents kd ...
UNION ALL
SELECT ..., 'seller' as kyc_type FROM seller_kyc sk ...
ORDER BY uploaded_at DESC
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### UNION Query
Combines results from multiple tables into single result set

### !important Flag
Overrides CSS specificity, forces style to apply

### Fixed Positioning
Element positioned relative to viewport, not parent

### Z-Index
Stacking order of elements (higher = on top)

---
