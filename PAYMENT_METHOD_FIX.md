# Payment Method Fix - Summary

## Issue
Users were getting errors when trying to add payment methods in the Account section, even though Stripe API keys were properly configured in the `.env` file.

## Root Cause
The `create-setup-intent.php` API was calling `checkStripeConfiguration()` which required ALL Stripe configuration including webhook secret. However:
- **Webhook secrets are only needed for processing Stripe webhooks** (e.g., payment confirmations, subscription updates)
- **Setup intents do NOT require webhook secrets** - they only need API keys (publishable and secret)

This caused a false error: `"Webhook secret not configured for {mode} mode"` even when the user's API keys were correctly set.

## Solution
Removed the `checkStripeConfiguration()` call from `create-setup-intent.php`. Now:
- The API only validates that API keys are configured (via `initStripe()`)
- `initStripe()` throws proper errors if secret or publishable keys are missing
- Webhook secret is no longer checked for payment method operations
- Webhook secret is still checked for webhook processing endpoints (where it's actually needed)

## What Changed

### Before (Broken)
```php
// Check if Stripe is configured before proceeding
$stripeConfig = checkStripeConfiguration();
if (!$stripeConfig['configured']) {
    throw new Exception(
        'Stripe is not configured. Please configure the following: ' . 
        implode(', ', $stripeConfig['errors']) . 
        '. Contact administrator to set up Stripe in the .env file.'
    );
}

// Initialize Stripe
$stripe = initStripe();
```

### After (Fixed)
```php
// Initialize Stripe (will throw exception if keys not configured)
$stripe = initStripe();
```

## Testing

### Steps to Test
1. Navigate to Account → Payment Methods tab
2. Click "Add Payment Method" button
3. ✅ Stripe form should load without errors
4. Enter card details and save
5. ✅ Payment method should be added successfully

### Expected Behavior
- **With API keys configured:** Payment method form loads and works
- **Without API keys configured:** Clear error message about missing API keys
- **No more webhook secret errors** for payment method operations

## Files Modified
- `api/payment-methods/create-setup-intent.php` - Removed webhook secret check

## Commit
- Hash: `5faf134`
- Message: "Fix payment method errors - remove webhook secret requirement for setup intents"

## Configuration Required
Users only need these in `.env` for payment methods to work:
```env
# For live mode
STRIPE_MODE=live
STRIPE_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxx
STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx

# OR for test mode
STRIPE_MODE=test
STRIPE_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
```

Webhook secrets are optional and only needed for webhook endpoints:
```env
# Optional - only needed for webhooks
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_LIVE=whsec_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TEST=whsec_xxxxx
```
